# rhoevm

`rhoevm` is a symbolic EVM execution engine written in Rust. It is inspired by [`hevm`](https://github.com/ethereum/hevm), which is implemented in Haskell. This project aims to provide a robust tool for analyzing Ethereum smart contracts by symbolically executing the EVM bytecode.


> [!CAUTION]
> Currently, this project is a work in progress.

## 1. Install

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- Rust: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Cargo: Rust's package manager should be installed with Rust.
- Z3 Solver: `rhoevm` requires the Z3 solver for constraint solving.

### 1.2 Building from Source

Clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/rhoevm.git
cd rhoevm
cargo build --release
# sudo cp ./target/release/rhoevm /usr/local/bin/rhoevm
```

### 1.3 Running Tests

Run tests to verify the installation:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Command-Line Interface

`rhoevm` is operated via the command line. The general syntax is as follows:

```bash
rhoevm CONTRACT_NAME FUNCTION_NAMES [options]
```

- Options

```
-d, --dir DIR: Specify the target directory where contract files are located.
-i, --max_num_iterations MAX_NUM_ITER: Maximum number of iterations for loop
-v, --verbose LEVEL: Set the verbosity level (0: error, 1: warn, 2: info, 3: debug, 4: trace).
-h, --help: Display help information.
```

Ensure that your environment is configured to locate the `.bin` and `.abi` files for the contracts. The filenames should match the contract name provided.

### 2.2 Example

Below is an example of how to use `rhoevm` with a simple Solidity smart contract.

- Example Solidity Contract

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleContract {
    function check(uint32 x, uint32 y) public pure {
        if (x > 0 && x < 100 && y > 0 && y < 100) {
            assert(x + y != 142);
        }
    }
}
```

- Symbolic Execution with `rhoevm`

```bash
# Compile the Solidity contract using solc or any preferred compiler.
# Assuming the compiled binary and ABI are located in ./example/build

$ rhoevm SimpleContract "check" -d ./example/build/
```

- Output

```bash

```

In the above example, `rhoevm` analyzes the `check` function of the SimpleAssert contract, highlighting a revert condition due to the failed assertion.
